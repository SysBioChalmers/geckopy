# Changelog

All notable changes to **geckopy** are documented here. The project uses
[PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) pre-release versioning.

## 4.0.0b1 — 2026-09-08

Version realignment: geckopy adopts GECKO's own toolbox-generation numbering
(MATLAB GECKO 1–3, geckopy = 4.x) instead of its own from-zero semver — see
the README for why. First release published to PyPI, and the first to ship
kcat tuning against experimental data.

* New: `kcat_tuning.evotune` fits `ec.kcat` to measured growth rates and
  exchange fluxes with CMA-ES (`screen_kcat_leverage`, `select_tunable_mask`,
  `cmaes_kcat_tuning`, `tune_prior_penalty_weight`), replacing the earlier
  ABC-SMC approach. `EvotuneResult.corrections()` reports a tuning run as a
  ranked table of what changed and why, rather than a raw kcat vector. Gated
  behind the new `evotune` extra.
* New: `gather_kcats.review.review_assignment` flags kcat-assignment
  problems (repeated values, EC-maximum fallback, implausible magnitude)
  worth curating before a tuning run.
* `kcat_sensitivity_analysis` renamed to `kcat_tuning`, with the CMA-ES
  subpackage named `evotune` rather than `bayesian` — the shipped method is
  CMA-ES, not Bayesian inference.
* `flexibilize_enz_concs`: the post-loop refinement now uses MATLAB's soft
  ±0.25% growth band instead of pinning to `exp_growth` exactly, matching
  `flexibilizeEnzConcs.m`.
* `make_ec_model` no longer splits exchange reactions in the irreversibility
  stage, matching `makeEcModel.m`'s `nonExchRxns` exclusion.
* `get_reactions_from_enzyme` now matches `protein_id` case-insensitively,
  matching MATLAB's `strcmpi`.
* `read_dlkcat_output` gained an opt-in `strict=True` fail-fast on
  unrecognized substrates, matching MATLAB, and now reports drop reasons
  separately instead of lumping them together.
* `assign_standard_kcat`: a NaN-kcat reaction no longer counts toward a
  subsystem's threshold eligibility or gets folded into the subsystem
  median; unset kcats now get filled for NaN too, not just literal zeros.
* `parse_okp_output` now tags provenance with the `OKP-` prefix MATLAB
  applies; `merge_kcats` strips it again before source-priority matching so
  tagged rows still rank correctly.
* `set_kcat_for_reactions` now accepts a per-isozyme kcat list against an
  un-suffixed base name (assigned positionally, matching MATLAB), and writes
  `ec.source = "setKcatForReactions"` (MATLAB's actual value) instead of
  `"manual"`.
* `ec_fseof`: scan floor now anchors to the production target's flux at
  biomass-optimum instead of a fixed fraction of the theoretical maximum,
  and candidates are restricted to gene-associated, non-standard reactions
  before classification — both matching `ecFSEOF.m`.
* `ec_fva`'s parallel path now uses `cobra.util.process_pool.ProcessPool`
  instead of a hand-rolled `multiprocessing.Pool` — fixes a slow Windows
  initializer handoff and gives graceful pool teardown. Public signature
  unchanged.
* `raven-toolbox` dependency switched from a `git+...@develop` pin to the
  PyPI `>=3.0.0b1` release, which carries the `convert_to_irreversible(...,
  rxns=...)` addition `make_ec_model` needs.
* Packaging: the sdist was bundling the entire local `.venv-win`
  virtualenv (~60MB, including a compiled scipy wheel) because `.gitignore`
  listed `.venv/` but not `.venv-win/`, and hatchling's default sdist
  selection only reads the top-level `.gitignore`.
* `release.yml`: PyPI publish job enabled (trusted publishing).
* README: disambiguation note simplified and repointed at the specific old
  `geckopy` release (`2.0.2` and earlier), now that this project has taken
  over the PyPI project name itself.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-08-30

Parity pass against the MATLAB GECKO Toolbox: geckopy's core functions now
reproduce every value GECKO's own unit-test suite pins down.

* New: `tests/test_gecko_matlab_parity.py`, a 1:1 port of GECKO's
  `test/unit_tests/geckoCoreFunctionTests.m` (47 tests, MATLAB test cases
  `tc0001`–`tc0013`), run against the same `ecTestGEM` fixture MATLAB uses.
  Every expected value is copied verbatim from the MATLAB sources rather than
  re-derived from geckopy's output, so the file is the executable definition
  of "geckopy builds the same ecModel as GECKO". Covers `makeEcModel` (full
  and light), `applyComplexData`, `setProtPoolSize`, `getECfromGEM`,
  `getECfromDatabase`, save/load round-trip, `fuzzyKcatMatching`,
  `writeDLKcatInput`, `mergeDLKcatAndFuzzyKcats`, `selectKcatValue`,
  `applyKcatConstraints`, `getKcatAcrossIsozymes`, `applyCustomKcats`,
  `findMetSmiles` and the proteomics-integration chain.
* `make_ec_model` now sorts identifiers for full models, as MATLAB
  `makeEcModel` does (`sortIdentifiers`, full models only, before the protein
  pseudoreactions are appended) — geckopy kept the input GEM's reaction
  order, so a full ecModel came out with the same reactions in a different
  order from MATLAB's.
* `write_dlkcat_input` now emits rows in reaction order, matching MATLAB's
  column-major `find(clearedRedS < 0)` — numpy's `where` is row-major, so
  geckopy grouped the DLKcat input by substrate instead of by reaction.
* `EcModel.copy()` now clones the `ec` substructure. `cobra.Model.copy`
  rebuilds the network but carried every other attribute over by reference,
  so `model.copy().ec` was the same `EcData` object as `model.ec` — writing
  a kcat, eccode, source, conc or coupling coefficient on the copy silently
  changed the model it was copied from. `adapter` stays a shared reference
  (project configuration, not model state); `copy.deepcopy(model)` was
  already correct and is unchanged.
* Reverse (`_REV`) reactions now keep their EC code, via a fix in
  raven-toolbox's `convert_to_irreversible` (it now copies annotations,
  subsystem and notes onto the reverse reaction, as MATLAB's
  `convertToIrrev` copies `eccodes`/`rxnMiriams`/`subSystems`/`rxnNotes`).
  Requires raven-toolbox at or after that fix.
* `copy.deepcopy(ec_model)` (and of any `cobra.Model`) no longer
  `RecursionError`s on Python 3.14. The cause was in cobra:
  `Reaction.__copy__`/`__deepcopy__` delegated to `super()` to avoid
  infinitely recursing into themselves, relying on `copy` memoizing an
  object before recursing into its state — Python 3.14's `copy` module
  stopped doing so for that code path. Fixed upstream in cobra 0.31.0 by
  deleting the overrides; requires cobra at or after 0.31.1.
* `examples/yeast-GEM`'s adapter config used a rejected pydantic field:
  `model_adapter.toml` set `uniprot.tax_id`, but `ModelParameters`'s schema
  has no such field (it's `id`, already defaulting to the taxonomy id), so
  `ModelAdapter.from_folder` raised a validation error unconditionally. A
  parametrized regression test now runs over every `examples/` subfolder to
  catch schema drift like this for any future adapter config too.
* Docstrings across geckopy's source and tests reviewed for clarity and
  accuracy: `MATLAB-COMPAT` comparison paragraphs replaced with plain
  statements of current behavior, other historical/regression narration
  dropped, stale docstrings corrected. Comment/docstring-only, no functional
  changes.
* `protein_pool.py`'s module docstring no longer claims `prot_pool_exchange`'s
  direction diverges from MATLAB pending a "future I/O layer" — GECKO
  MATLAB's `makeEcModel.m` already writes the same forward (`lb=0`,
  `ub=1000`) convention as geckopy; the reverse convention only applies to
  legacy pre-GECKO-4 files, which `load_ec_model.py` already normalizes on
  load.
* `mw.py`'s stale `MATLAB-COMPAT` comments removed now that `calculate_mw`
  matches GECKO MATLAB's current water-mass constant (18.01528) and mean
  X-residue mass (118.885), closed upstream as GECKO#459. No behavioral
  change.
* Removed the dead `_run_preprocess` stub from `test_populate_ec`: an empty
  helper that was never called.
* `merge_kcats` is n-ary and concatenates surviving rows list by list, so
  the equivalent of MATLAB's `mergeDLKcatAndFuzzyKcats(dlkcat, fuzzy)` —
  which always emits fuzzy rows first regardless of argument order — is
  `merge_kcats(fuzzy, dlkcat, ...)`. The deprecated
  `merge_dlkcat_and_fuzzy_kcats` alias is `merge_kcats`, so it follows the
  geckopy convention, not MATLAB's signature. Row order has no numerical
  effect: `apply_kcat_list` aggregates per reaction.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-07-16

Bugfix release. `make_ec_model` no longer mutates the GEM it is given.

* `make_ec_model` now leaves the input GEM unchanged. Stages 1–5
  (`remove_pseudoreaction_gprs`, `invert_backwards_only_reactions`,
  `convert_to_irreversible`, `expand_model`) ran in place on the caller's
  model, leaving it with `_REV`/`_EXP_` reaction splits, `prot_`
  pseudometabolites, and stripped pseudoreaction GPRs. The pipeline now
  works on an internal `model.copy()`, matching MATLAB GECKO's
  `makeEcModel` value semantics.
* `test_loads_sbml_gem` on Windows: the test wrote a backslash path into the
  adapter TOML, which TOML reads as an escape sequence.
* README: disambiguation note stating that this geckopy is a from-scratch
  port of the MATLAB GECKO Toolbox, unrelated to and sharing no code with
  the separate PyPI `geckopy` package described in Carrasco Muriel et al.
  (2023).
* CI: leaner test matrix — full Python range (3.11–3.13) on Linux plus a
  single Python (3.12) on macOS and Windows, instead of the full 3×3
  OS × Python grid. Same OS coverage at roughly half the runner cost.
* Removed unused test imports flagged by ruff (F401).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-06-14

Dependency rename + CI hardening. geckopy now targets raven-toolbox (the
renamed raven-python) and runs its test matrix on every pull request.

* Depend on `raven-toolbox` (renamed from `raven-python`): all imports are
  now `raven_toolbox.*`, and the `pyproject.toml` git-URL dependency and
  project URL point at `SysBioChalmers/raven-toolbox`.
* Use the public `raven_toolbox.manipulation.expand.gpr_to_dnf` instead of
  the former private `_gpr_to_dnf`.
* CI: run the test matrix on every pull request, not only PRs into
  `main`/`master`.
* CI: bump GitHub Actions to Node 24 runtimes — `checkout@v5`,
  `setup-python@v6`, `upload-artifact@v7`, `download-artifact@v8`.
* Rewrote `migrating_from_gecko_matlab.md` as a complete reference; moved
  internal planning notes into `docs/internal/`.

## 0.1.0a3 — 2026-05-30

Build-config hotfix. v0.1.0a2 was tagged but its release.yml build failed:
hatchling refuses PEP 508 direct-URL dependencies (`raven-toolbox @
git+https://...`) by default. The v0.1.0a2 tag and release were deleted;
v0.1.0a3 is the published artifact carrying the 0.1.0a2 content described
below. No code changes vs. v0.1.0a2.

* `pyproject.toml`: `[tool.hatch.metadata] allow-direct-references = true`
  so hatchling accepts the `raven-toolbox` git URL dependency. PyPI publish
  stays disabled (geckopy's name is taken, raven-toolbox isn't on PyPI yet);
  the direct reference is acceptable for the git-install path the alpha
  series uses.

## 0.1.0a2 — 2026-05-30

Second public alpha. Layering pass: the bits of geckopy that aren't
GECKO-specific moved into raven-toolbox, and `gecko-light` ecModels are now
buildable end-to-end. Repo housekeeping for a discoverable first GitHub
release (LICENSE, planning docs out of the user-facing tree).

* gecko-light end-to-end: `make_ec_model(gecko_light=True)` now produces a
  working light ecModel — cobra reactions stay singular; per-isozyme
  coupling lives in `ec.rxns` as duplicate rows with a `###_` counter
  prefix; only the shared `prot_pool` constrains enzyme usage.
  `apply_kcat_constraints` picks the lowest-cost (smallest `MW_sum/kcat`)
  isozyme per cobra reaction and writes one `prot_pool` stoichiometric
  coefficient. `set_kcat_for_reactions` recognises both base names and the
  `###_` prefix; the `Enzyme` proxy's read paths work on light models. New
  `tutorials/light_ecModel/protocol.py` mirrors MATLAB GECKO's light
  tutorial; opt-in Human-GEM smoke test (`pytest -m smoke`) builds an
  ecModel from the unmodified Human-GEM YAML in ~2.5 min. See
  [`docs/gecko_light_status.md`](docs/gecko_light_status.md).
* YAML I/O delegated to raven-toolbox: `save_ec_model`/`load_ec_model` are
  now ~80-LOC wrappers around `raven_toolbox.io.read_yaml_model`/
  `write_yaml_model`. raven-toolbox owns the typed `EcData` (now
  re-exported as `geckopy.EcData`), the `ec-rxns`/`ec-enzymes`/`gecko_light`
  YAML schema, and the three legacy GECKO normalisations (top-level
  `smiles` → `annotation`, reverse-direction `usage_prot_*` flip, bare-`-`
  document root). Geckopy keeps file-extension dispatch, adapter-aware path
  resolution, and provenance/diagnostics. SBML ecModel I/O removed
  (`geckopy.io.sbml` deleted; `cobra.io.read_sbml_model` is still used for
  loading the conventional starting GEM). See
  [`docs/raven_integration.md`](docs/raven_integration.md).
* `ec_fseof` re-aligned with `raven_toolbox.analysis.fseof`: thin wrapper
  over raven's regression-based FSEOF, dropping `usage_prot_*` from the
  scan + targets, resolving `bio_rxn` from the adapter, and emitting an
  optional carbon-source consistency warning. Selection moves from MATLAB
  GECKO's strict-monotonicity + top-25%-by-slope to raven's
  `|correlation| ≥ threshold` with pFBA per step. Result type is raven's
  `FSEOFResult` (replaces `EcFseofResult`); action labels are
  `amplify`/`knockdown`/`knockout` (replaces `OE`/`KD`/`KO`); the per-gene
  `essentiality` column drops (use
  `cobra.flux_analysis.single_gene_deletion`).
* `raven-toolbox` pin moved from `@main` to `@develop`. raven-toolbox's
  `main` is empty in the current iteration; all releaseable work lives on
  `develop`.
* `get_conc_control_coeffs` solver-state guard: both `_shadow_price_coeffs`
  and `_finite_difference_coeffs` previously accepted any solve whose
  `objective_value` was non-`None` and non-NaN, including infeasible
  glpk-via-optlang solves (which return `status="infeasible"` but a
  non-NaN objective from the binding-constraint rhs). New
  `_solution_is_optimal` helper requires `sol.status == "optimal"` at every
  solve point.
* Removed `geckopy.io.sbml.{read,write}_sbml_ec_model` and the `geckopy.io`
  package (SBML ecModel I/O dropped; YAML is the supported on-disk format).
* Removed `geckopy.EcFseofResult` (use
  `raven_toolbox.analysis.fseof.FSEOFResult`).
* Removed the top-level `requirements.txt` (a `pip freeze` snapshot that
  duplicated `pyproject.toml`'s declared dependencies); pyproject is the
  source of truth.
* Internal planning docs (`brenda_refresh_plan`, `openkineticspredictor_plan`,
  `porting_plan`, `raven_inventory`, `code_review`) moved from `docs/` to
  `docs/internal/` so the user-facing docs tree only carries reference
  documentation.
* `LICENSE` file added (MIT was already declared in `pyproject.toml` and
  classifier; the text file was missing).

## 0.1.0a1 — 2026-05-30

First public alpha. Every MATLAB GECKO 3.2.5 function used in the standard
ecModel build is ported; the yeast-GEM tutorial runs end-to-end.

* Project skeleton: `EcModel`/`EcData`/`Enzyme` core classes built on
  cobrapy; `ModelParameters`/`ModelAdapter` scaffolding (TOML-driven config,
  template generator, `geckopy init` CLI).
* `make_ec_model` pipeline: 9-stage MATLAB-port pipeline that builds an
  ecModel from a conventional GEM + adapter. Fixes a unit bug where MW
  values were treated as kDa instead of Da.
* Kcat constraints + protein-complex/MW: `apply_kcat_constraints`,
  `set_kcat_for_reactions`, `apply_custom_kcats`, isozyme averaging, Complex
  Portal loader, `find_met_smiles`, `calculate_mw`.
* BRENDA + DLKcat pipelines: EC-code resolution helpers,
  `fuzzy_kcat_matching` MATLAB-port against BRENDA, DLKcat wrappers
  (`write_dlkcat_input`, `run_dlkcat`, `read_dlkcat_output`), standard-kcat
  fallback.
* Wide BRENDA snapshot: `kcat.tsv`/`sa.tsv`/`mw.tsv` ship both `max` and
  `median` per `(ec, substrate, organism)` triple (plus `n` = measurement
  count). `BrendaData.kcat_for("max" | "median")` picks the view; three
  adapter fields (`kcat_aggregate_brenda`/`kcat_aggregate_candidates`/
  `kcat_aggregate_isozymes`) let projects flip aggregation defaults
  globally. See [`docs/kcat_aggregation.md`](docs/kcat_aggregation.md).
* Generalised kcat merge: `merge_kcats` records per-row provenance and
  accepts any combination of BRENDA/DLKcat/OpenKineticsPredictor/manual
  sources.
* Data-source downloaders: `geckopy brenda-refresh` CLI (BRENDA bulk JSON),
  KEGG as an alternative protein/EC source (with a warning when fallback
  uses a bare KEGG gene id), OpenKineticsPredictor REST-API submit/fetch
  wrappers, YAML I/O aligned with cobrapy + GECKO keys.
* Protein concentrations + sigma + sensitivity: `calculate_f_factor` +
  `load_pax_db`, `fill_enz_concs`, `constrain_enz_concs`,
  `get_conc_control_coeffs`, `flexibilize_enz_concs`, `constrain_flux_data`;
  sigma fitting and `sensitivity_tuning`.
* Analysis utilities: `load_flux_data`, `load_prot_data`, `enzyme_usage` +
  `report_enzyme_usage`, `map_rxns_to_conv`, `ec_fva`, `ec_fseof`,
  `add_new_rxns_to_ec`, `get_subset_ec_model`.
* Persistence: `load_ec_model` + `save_ec_model` (YAML + SBML round-trip
  with `ec_*` metadata), `merge_dlkcat_and_fuzzy_kcats`,
  `load_conventional_gem`.
* Enzyme accessor + analysis utilities + SBML I/O: `Enzyme`/`EnzymeView`
  accessor, `pfba_enzymes`, `get_enzyme_bottlenecks`, parallel `ec_fva` via
  multiprocessing, `relax_proteomics_greedy`, SBML reader/writer with
  MW_KCAT encoding, flatter top-level imports.
* Dedup, renames, splits: de-duped ec-layer constants across 12 files,
  renamed 7 functions for verb-style consistency (with deprecated aliases),
  flattened top-level API, `resolve_adapter` helper, `fuzzy_kcat_matching`
  split into a 4-file subpackage, SBML name aliases, auto-flip of legacy
  reverse-direction protein reactions, `ec.kcat` sentinel switched from
  `NaN` to `0`.
* Bisect sigma, shadow-price control coeffs, diagonal ecFVA, median kcat:
  `fit_sigma(method="bisect")` exploiting monotonicity; `calculate_mw`
  returns NaN on empty/all-skipped sequence; `get_conc_control_coeffs`
  switches to LP shadow-price with scipy auto-fallback; `ec_fva` reports
  the exact per-reaction range (diagonal); `median` option for kcat
  aggregation.
* Code review hardening — silent-data-loss guards: `genes`-list length
  validation, numpy-scalar coercion, kcat/relaxation loop non-termination
  guards, enzyme-provenance round-trip across SBML, UniProt-accession
  dedup, Complex Portal sub-complex classification, downloader hardening,
  NaN-aware kcat overwrite, non-fatal DLKcat unknown-substrate handling,
  `ec_fseof`/`pfba_enzymes` feasibility checks, OKP GET retries, current
  PubChem SMILES property, perf hoists, BayesianParams length validation,
  robust BRENDA protein lookup.
* Code review hardening — adapter decoupling: adapter-free read/inspect of
  ecModels; per-parameter overrides decouple analysis functions from the
  adapter; `bio_rxn` overrides + loader robustness; writable BRENDA data
  kept out of the install tree.
* Code review hardening — cleanup: sanity guards + DLKcat ignore-list
  header tolerance; dedup helpers + standardised infeasibility check;
  dead-code removal; tuned-kcat capping + negative-concentration guards;
  dropped private back-compat aliases in `fuzzy_kcat_matching`.
* Tutorial + packaging: full_ecModel notebook tutorial walking through
  Stages 0–5 (build → proteomics → simulation), `ec_fva` tqdm progress bar,
  ruff baseline, `.gitattributes` LF enforcement, PyPI-ready packaging
  metadata, GitHub Actions for tests/lint/release.
* Docs sweep: README rewrite for non-specialist readability, friendlier
  docstrings on the public-API modules, Carrasco et al. (2023) citation,
  third-party library gotchas (SBML/multiprocessing/ruamel), RAVEN function
  inventory + ravenpy scope, gecko-light status.
* raven-toolbox is now a hard dependency: geckopy delegates `expand_model`
  and `convert_to_irreversible` to raven-toolbox (the functions originated
  in geckopy and were adopted upstream as their canonical home).
  raven-toolbox is not yet on PyPI; install both via the git URLs in the
  README. See [`docs/raven_integration.md`](docs/raven_integration.md) for
  the current delegation and the planned future migrations.
