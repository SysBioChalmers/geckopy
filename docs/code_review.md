## kcat aggregation — resolved

Decision: keep all shipped defaults at the MATLAB-GECKO values. The
adapter exposes three dedicated fields for project-wide overrides, and
the BRENDA snapshot ships both max and median per (ec, substrate,
organism) triple so flipping the runtime default does not require
regenerating the snapshot.

| function | adapter param | shipped default | other allowed values |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fuzzy_kcat_matching` | `params.kcat_aggregate_brenda` | `"max"` | `"median"` |
| `apply_kcat_list` | `params.kcat_aggregate_candidates` | `"max"` | `"min"`, `"median"`, `"mean"` |
| `fill_kcats_from_isozymes` | `params.kcat_aggregate_isozymes` | `"mean"` | `"max"`, `"median"` |

`fuzzy_kcat_matching` now picks the matching snapshot view
(`brenda.kcat_for(aggregate)` / `brenda.sa_for(aggregate)`) and applies
the same aggregation across the rows that survive the EC + organism +
substrate gates. So both layers — the per-triple snapshot collapse and
the per-EC runtime collapse — move together when the adapter setting
flips.

See [docs/kcat_aggregation.md](kcat_aggregation.md) for the empirical
comparison; `parse.py`'s range collapse (`"0.1-2.5"` → upper bound) is
the one remaining max-leaning step in the pipeline. Small effect (only
fires on the subset of measurements reported as ranges) and not
wired — leave for a future ticket if it surfaces.
