    """Copy EC codes from ``model.ec.eccodes`` to per-reaction

    top-level ``model.eccodes``).

    Ported from GECKO MATLAB:
    src/geckomat/get_enzyme_data/copyECtoGEM.m.

    For each entry of ``model.ec.rxns`` (after stripping a 4-char
    prefix when the model is in gecko-light mode), the corresponding
    cobra.Reaction's ``annotation['ec-code']`` is written as a list
    of EC tokens split from the ``;``-joined ``ec.eccodes[i]``
    string. Empty ``ec.eccodes`` entries are skipped: they neither
    create new annotations nor clobber existing ones, even with
    ``overwrite=True``.

    With ``overwrite=False`` (default) only reactions whose current
    ``ec-code`` annotation is missing or empty (``""``, ``[]``,
    ``None``) are updated. With ``overwrite=True`` any non-empty
    ``ec.eccodes[i]`` replaces the current annotation.

    MATLAB-COMPAT: GECKO MATLAB writes EC codes into a top-level
    ``model.eccodes`` cell array. cobrapy stores them per-reaction
    in ``reaction.annotation['ec-code']``; geckopy writes there.

    MATLAB-COMPAT: GECKO MATLAB writes the raw ``;``-joined string
    into the cell. geckopy splits on ``;`` and writes a ``list[str]``
    (cobrapy idiom). Round-trip with ``fill_eccodes_from_gem`` is stable
    because that function's ``_normalize_annotation`` joins lists
    back to ``;``-separated strings.

    MATLAB-COMPAT: GECKO MATLAB with ``overwrite=true`` overwrites
    existing entries even when ``ec.eccodes[i]`` is empty (writing an
    empty cell). geckopy treats empty ``ec.eccodes`` entries as "no
    info to propagate" and never clobbers an existing annotation
    with emptiness.

    Reactions in the cobra model that are absent from
    ``model.ec.rxns`` are left untouched. Entries of
    ``model.ec.rxns`` that do not match any cobra reaction are
    silently skipped.
