"""Greedy shadow-price-ordered relaxation of proteomics constraints.

Ported from the legacy geckopy package described in Carrasco et al.
(2023, https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.01705-23), file
geckopy/experimental/relaxation.py
(relax_proteomics_greedy), adapted to the new substrate.

Algorithm: while the model can't reach ``minimal_growth``, find
the enzyme with the largest absolute shadow price among those
still proteomics-constrained, relax it (set usage upper bound
back to the unconstrained default), re-solve, repeat. Returns
the set of relaxed enzymes and a step-by-step trace.

Different relaxation strategy from
``flexibilize_enz_concs``: this one is
shadow-price-ordered (purely LP-driven), and often converges in
fewer iterations on different infeasibility shapes (e.g. when one
or two enzymes dominate the binding behaviour).

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        EcModel with proteomics-constrained enzymes (some
        ``usage_prot_<id>`` reactions have finite upper bounds
        from ``constrain_enz_concs``).
    minimal_growth
        Target objective value.
    enzyme_set
        Subset of uniprot IDs eligible for relaxation. ``None`` =
        all currently proteomics-constrained enzymes.
    max_iterations
        Safety cap; raises ``RuntimeError`` if exceeded without
        convergence.
    default_upper_bound
        Value to restore on a relaxed usage reaction. Matches the
        default set by ``add_protein_usage_reactions``.

    Returns
    -------
    GreedyRelaxResult
        ``relaxed`` maps uniprot to the original concentration
        (so the caller can restore if desired); ``trace`` records
        each step; ``converged`` is True iff
        ``final_growth >= minimal_growth``.
