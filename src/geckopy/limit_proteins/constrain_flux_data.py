"""Set model exchange-flux bounds from an experimental dataset.

In a typical chemostat experiment you measure exchange fluxes
(substrate uptake, byproduct secretion, biomass growth rate)
under one or more growth conditions. This function takes a
``FluxData`` (parsed from ``fluxData.tsv``), picks one condition,
and applies those measurements as bounds on the matching
exchange reactions in the model.

The ``loose_strict_flux`` argument controls how tightly: ``"loose"``
gives the model room to wiggle around the measurement; a numeric
percentage clamps it within that band.

    Sets the biomass reaction bounds to the measured growth rate and
    each exchange reaction in ``flux_data.exch_rxn_ids`` to its
    measured flux for the chosen condition. Also zeros out the
    adapter's preferred carbon source so the data drives the choice.

    Ported from GECKO MATLAB:

    A ``+/-1000`` measured flux means unconstrained, regardless of
    ``loose_strict_flux``:
    ``-1000`` -> ``lb=-1000, ub=0`` (free uptake), ``+1000`` ->
    ``lb=0, ub=1000`` (free excretion).

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        EcModel with the exchange reactions referenced by
        ``flux_data`` already in place. Mutated in place.
    flux_data
        Pre-loaded FluxData (typically from a future
        ``load_flux_data`` utility).
    condition
        Either the 0-indexed condition number, or the condition name
        (matched against ``flux_data.conds``).
    max_min_growth
        ``"max"`` sets ``bio_rxn`` upper bound to the measured
        growth rate (and lower bound to 0); ``"min"`` sets the lower
        bound (suitable when minimising ``prot_pool_exchange``).
    loose_strict_flux
        ``"loose"`` keeps one bound at 0 and the other at the
        measured value (allows zero flux). A numeric percentage
        ``p`` brackets the measured value with hard bounds:
        ``lb = val * (1 - p/200)``, ``ub = val * (1 + p/200)``,
        swapped as needed to keep ``lb <= ub`` when ``val`` is
        negative. ``p=10`` allows 10% total variance (i.e. +/-5%).
    bio_rxn
        Biomass reaction ID. Defaults to the adapter's configured
        biomass reaction (``model.adapter.params.bio_rxn``) when
        ``None``.
    c_source
        Reaction ID of the preferred carbon-source uptake reaction;
        its bounds are set to ``(0, 0)`` before applying the flux
        data so that the data alone determines the carbon source
        used. Defaults to ``model.adapter.params.c_source`` (or no
        blocking if there is no adapter) when ``None``; pass ``""``
        to skip blocking any reaction. Silently ignored if the
        reaction id is not found in the model.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``model.adapter`` is None, ``max_min_growth`` /
        ``loose_strict_flux`` is invalid, ``condition`` (as string)
        is not in ``flux_data.conds``, or any
        ``flux_data.exch_rxn_ids`` is missing from the model.
    IndexError
        If ``condition`` (as int) is out of range.
