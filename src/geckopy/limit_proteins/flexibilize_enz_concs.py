"""Loosen proteomics constraints until the model can grow.

After ``constrain_enz_concs`` pins each measured enzyme to its
proteomics value, the model often can't reach the experimental
growth rate any more — the measurements are noisy, and a few
enzymes end up too tightly capped to feed the network.

``flexibilize_enz_concs`` fixes that automatically. It computes a
control coefficient per enzyme (how much each enzyme's bound is
limiting growth), picks the worst one, multiplies its upper bound
by ``fold_change``, re-solves, and repeats until growth reaches
the target. The result records which enzymes were loosened and by
how much, so a curator can review.

A related function is ``relax_proteomics_greedy`` in the same
package: same goal, different algorithm. This one ranks by control
coefficient, relaxes gradually, and runs a tighten-back pass, so it
yields the *minimal* (most proteomics-faithful) relaxation but is
slower. ``relax_proteomics_greedy`` ranks by shadow price and fully
unconstrains each picked enzyme — faster, but looser. See
``docs/relaxation_methods.md`` for the full comparison.

    ``min prot_pool_exchange  s.t. bio_rxn >= exp_growth`` (a hard

    concentration, the original constraint is restored (i.e. that
    enzyme is dropped from the result). This avoids over-relaxing
    enzymes that the prior iterative pass increased more than

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        EcModel with `prot_pool_exchange` and ``usage_prot_*``
        reactions installed and ``model.ec.concs`` populated for at
        least some enzymes (typically by ``fill_enz_concs`` and
        ``constrain_enz_concs``). Mutated in place; ``ec.concs``
        itself is left unchanged.
    exp_growth
        Target growth rate. Defaults to
        ``model.adapter.params.gr_exp``.
    fold_change
        Controls how much the limiting enzyme's usage upper bound
        grows each time it is picked: on its ``k``-th pick, the
        bound is set to ``original_conc * (1 + fold_change * k)``.
    iter_per_enzyme
        Maximum number of times the same enzyme may be picked before
        warning and breaking. ``0`` means no limit.
    bio_rxn
        Biomass reaction id. Defaults to ``params.bio_rxn`` from the
        adapter; pass it (with ``exp_growth``) to run without an adapter.
    verbose
        Whether per-iteration progress is logged at INFO.
