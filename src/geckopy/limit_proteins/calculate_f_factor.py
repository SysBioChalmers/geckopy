"""Compute the f-factor for an ecModel.

The f-factor is the fraction of the cell's total protein mass
that the enzymes in the model account for. (The rest is ribosomes,
structural proteins, transcription factors, etc. — proteins that
don't catalyse a metabolic reaction in the model.)

The protein pool's upper bound is set to
``P_tot * f * sigma``, so getting f right matters: too low and
the model is under-constrained (artificially easy to grow); too
high and it's over-constrained (artificially hard).

geckopy computes f from proteomics data (a ``ProtData`` table
loaded by ``load_pax_db`` or similar): for each measured protein,
check whether it's in the model, sum the masses, divide by the
total. A default value of 0.5 is a reasonable starting point when
no proteomics data is available.

    """Compute the f-factor for an ec model.

    The f-factor is the mass fraction of total cellular protein that
    is accounted for by enzymes in the model. It is computed as

        f = sum(abundances of in-model enzymes) / sum(all abundances)

    where abundances are read from a pre-loaded ``ProtData`` (typically
    populated via ``load_pax_db``).

    For 2-D ``abundances`` (multiple proteomics samples), the
    per-protein average is taken first via ``np.nanmean(axis=1)``.

    MATLAB-COMPAT: GECKO MATLAB takes a ``modelAdapter`` and a
    ``protData`` that may be a struct OR a path. geckopy splits the
    file-loading concern out into ``load_pax_db`` and takes a
    pre-loaded ``ProtData`` here.

    MATLAB-COMPAT: GECKO MATLAB silently returns 0.5 when no
    proteome data is provided. geckopy requires the caller to handle
    the missing-data case explicitly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        EcModel; only used to default ``enzymes`` to
        ``model.ec.enzymes``.
    prot_data
        Pre-loaded proteomics data.
    enzymes
        UniProt IDs counted as "in the model". Defaults to
        ``model.ec.enzymes``.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The f-factor in [0, 1]. Returns 0.0 if the total proteome
        abundance is zero.
