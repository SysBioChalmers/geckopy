"""Shared helper to resolve which ``ModelAdapter`` a function should use.

Many geckopy functions need an adapter for organism parameters
(taxonomy id, biomass reaction, ...) or for paths to data files.
There are two ways a caller might supply one:

- pass it explicitly as an ``adapter=...`` keyword argument;
- attach it to the model as ``model.adapter`` (the common case
  after ``make_ec_model``, which sets it automatically).

``resolve_adapter`` consolidates the "explicit-arg-or-fallback-to-
``model.adapter``-or-raise" pattern that 30+ functions duplicated
inline, with inconsistent error messages.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        Any object that may have an ``.adapter`` attribute (a cobra
        Model, an EcModel, ...). ``getattr`` is used so plain
        ``cobra.Model`` doesn't trip on the missing attribute.
    adapter
        An explicitly-passed adapter. If non-None, returned as-is
        (takes priority over ``model.adapter``).
    purpose
        Short description of why the calling function needs an
        adapter; included in the error message when none can be
        resolved. Example: ``"to read params.enzyme_comp"``.

    Returns
    -------
    ModelAdapter
        Either ``adapter`` (if given) or ``model.adapter``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If both ``adapter`` and ``model.adapter`` are ``None``. The
        message tells the caller how to fix it.

    explicit
