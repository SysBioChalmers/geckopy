"""Find the enzymes that are limiting the current objective.

When you solve an ecModel, some enzymes are saturated and some
have spare capacity. The saturated ones are the ones whose
removal (or whose increased availability) would shift the
objective — they're the *bottlenecks*. The LP's shadow price for
each ``prot_<id>`` mass-balance constraint quantifies that
sensitivity directly.

``get_enzyme_bottlenecks`` runs the solve, ranks every enzyme by
absolute shadow price, and returns the top N as a DataFrame. The
top row is the enzyme whose extra availability would help the
objective the most.
