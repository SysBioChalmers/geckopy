"""Save an ecModel to a YAML file.

Thin wrapper around :func:`raven_toolbox.io.write_yaml_model`. raven-toolbox
owns the YAML schema for the ec sections (see
``raven_toolbox.io.ec_data``): given a ``model`` with a populated
``model.ec`` (an :class:`~raven_toolbox.io.EcData`), it serialises both the
cobra-shaped portion and the ``ec-rxns`` / ``ec-enzymes`` / ``gecko_light``
top-level sections.

geckopy keeps three application-level concerns:

1. **File-extension validation** — only ``.yml`` / ``.yaml`` is accepted.
   SBML ecModel I/O has been removed; raise a helpful ValueError if the
   caller passes ``.xml`` / ``.sbml``.
2. **Adapter-aware path resolution** — relative filenames resolve under
   ``<adapter.params.path>/models/<filename>``.
3. **Empty-ecModel guard + provenance injection** — fast-fail when the
   caller forgot to run ``make_ec_model``; write a small ``metaData``
   block (date + geckopy version + description) so saved files carry
   provenance information.

MATLAB-COMPAT: MATLAB ``saveEcModel`` mutates the input model
(``ecModel.description = ['Enzyme-constrained model of ' ecModel.id]``).
geckopy writes the description into the output ``metaData`` only; the
caller's model is mutated transiently (provenance stashed on
``model.notes`` for the duration of the write) and restored afterwards.

MATLAB-COMPAT: MATLAB falls back to ``ModelAdapterManager.getDefault()``
when no adapter is supplied. geckopy has no global default adapter —
pass one explicitly, rely on ``model.adapter``, or use an absolute
filename.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        The ecModel to save. Must have a populated ``model.ec`` (both
        ``ec.rxns`` and ``ec.enzymes`` non-empty). Empty ecModels are
        rejected because they're almost always a bug — you probably
        forgot to run ``make_ec_model`` first.
    filename
        Destination path. If ``None``, defaults to ``ecModel.yml``.
        Relative paths resolve against
        ``<adapter.params.path>/models/<filename>``; absolute paths are
        used as-is.
    adapter
        Used to resolve a relative ``filename``. Defaults to
        ``model.adapter``. Required when ``filename`` is relative AND
        ``model.adapter`` is ``None``.

    -------
    Path
        The absolute path of the file that was written.

    ------

        If ``model.ec`` is empty, if the file extension isn't YAML, or
