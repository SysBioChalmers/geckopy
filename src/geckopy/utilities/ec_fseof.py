"""Flux-Scanning with Enforced Objective Function for an ecModel.

Thin wrapper around :func:`raven_toolbox.analysis.fseof.fseof` that adds
ec-specific concerns on top of raven's general-purpose FSEOF:

- resolves the biomass reaction from ``model.adapter`` when not passed
  explicitly;
- optionally runs a carbon-source consistency check (warns when the
  carbon-source lower bound is tighter than its uptake at biomass-max);
- anchors the scan's floor to the production-target reaction's flux at
  biomass-optimum (matching ``ecFSEOF.m``'s ``iniTarget``), rather than
  raven-toolbox's default fixed-fraction-of-maximum floor;
- restricts targets (and the reported scan) to gene-associated
  reactions whose GPR doesn't reference the "standard" placeholder
  pseudogene, matching ``ecFSEOF.m``'s candidate-set restriction;
- filters ``usage_prot_*`` rows out of the returned ``scan`` /
  ``targets`` DataFrames — those reactions are protein-pool plumbing,
  never engineering targets.

The selection method and output shape come from raven-toolbox: each
reaction's flux is regressed against the enforced product flux across
the scan, and a reaction is a target if ``|correlation| >=
correlation_threshold`` and ``|slope| >= flux_eps``. Targets are
classified as ``amplify`` / ``knockdown`` / ``knockout``. See
:class:`raven_toolbox.analysis.fseof.FSEOFResult` for the full output
schema.

Ported from GECKO MATLAB: ``src/geckomat/utilities/ecFSEOF.m``,
re-designed around :func:`raven_toolbox.analysis.fseof.fseof`.

Callers who want the result tables on disk can call
``result.targets.to_csv(...)`` themselves. Per-gene essentiality is
not computed here; use :func:`cobra.flux_analysis.single_gene_deletion`,
which works directly on ecModels since GPRs already gate the catalysed
reactions. Targets come back as one combined table; split it into
reaction vs. transport subsets yourself via the ``subsystem`` column
or by inspecting each reaction's metabolites.

    """Run Flux-Scanning with Enforced Objective Function on an ecModel.

    Enforces an increasing flux toward ``prod_target_rxn`` while
    optimising biomass, runs pFBA at each step, regresses every
    reaction's flux against the enforced product flux, and returns
    reactions with strong slope-vs-correlation signal as engineering
    targets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        EcModel with the protein-pool / usage-rxn machinery.
    prod_target_rxn
        Reaction id for the production target (typically a
        product-exchange).
    cs_rxn
        Reaction id for the main carbon source. When passed, a warning
        is emitted if its lower bound is tighter than its uptake at
        biomass-max (a common mis-configuration). ``None`` skips the
        check.
    n_steps
        Number of enforced-flux levels in the scan. Default 10.
    bio_rxn
        Biomass reaction id. Defaults to ``adapter.params.bio_rxn`` when
        ``model.adapter`` is set.
    max_fraction
        Top of the scan range as a fraction of the theoretical maximum
        product flux. Default 0.9. The floor of the scan range is the
        production target's flux at biomass-optimum, not a fraction of
        this ceiling.
    correlation_threshold
        A reaction is a target when ``|corr(flux, enforced)| >=`` this
        value. Default 0.9.
    flux_eps
        Minimum ``|slope|`` (flux change per enforced-flux step) for
        a reaction to count as responsive; below this it is treated
        as flat regardless of correlation, so it cannot become a
        target. Default 1e-6.

    Returns
    -------
    FSEOFResult
        raven-toolbox's FSEOF output dataclass, with ``usage_prot_*``
        rows filtered out of both ``scan`` and ``targets``. See
        :class:`raven_toolbox.analysis.fseof.FSEOFResult` for the full
        field list (``scan``, ``enforced``, ``targets``, plus the
        ``amplification`` / ``knockout`` / ``gene_targets`` properties).
