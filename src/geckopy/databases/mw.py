    """Compute the molecular weight of a protein from its sequence.

    Ported from GECKO MATLAB:
    src/geckomat/get_enzyme_data/calculateMW.m.

    Each residue contributes its average mass; one water mass is added
    once (representing the H + OH at the peptide termini, equivalent to
    one un-eliminated water relative to N residues + N water masses).

    Recognized amino acid codes (the sequence is uppercased first, so
    matching is case-insensitive):

        ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY  - the 20 standard residues
        BJOZUX                - non-standard / ambiguous codes

    Whitespace and digits are skipped silently. Any other unrecognized
    character is also skipped, but triggers one warning per call
    listing every distinct offending character.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence
        Protein sequence as a string. May contain whitespace, digits,
        and other non-letter characters; those are ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Molecular weight in g/mol (Da). Returns ``nan`` for an
        empty/all-skipped sequence (no residues), so a missing sequence
        is not mistaken for an 18 Da "protein".
