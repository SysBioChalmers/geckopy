"""Flag kcat assignments that deserve a second look.

The tuner's largest corrections are rarely discoveries about biology.
They are places the assignment went wrong: a value derived from one
specific-activity measurement, a database maximum standing in for a
distribution with a two-hundred-fold spread, one fallback number reused
across a whole family of reactions. Finding those directly is cheaper
than inferring them from a fit, and a corrected prior propagates to
every model built from the same databases, where a tuned kcat stays in
the model it was tuned on.

Two design choices, both from measurement rather than taste.

**Rank by leverage, and cut the report there.** On ecYeastGEM the
checks below flag around 1900 of 4834 kcats, which is a report nobody
reads. Tightening the checks does not fix that: raising the EC-maximum
gap from three-fold to ten-fold still returns 216 entries and drops
*all six* of the high-leverage ones, because looking odd and mattering
are unrelated properties. Filtering by leverage keeps the list short
and keeps the entries worth a curator's time.

**Report a parameter once.** Isozyme copies the assignment could not
separate share a value and a source, so they share a finding; listing
them separately fills the report with duplicates of one decision.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ec_stats
        Per-EC database summary. Checks needing it are skipped when it
        is absent, so the function still runs without a database.
    enzymes
        Protein ids per kcat, used to count how many other reactions
        share an enzyme -- a change here may imply changes there.
    leverage
        Per-kcat effect on the distance from a one-at-a-time screen.
        Without it the findings cannot be ranked and are returned in
        input order.
    coverage, top
        Truncate the report. ``coverage`` keeps the rows carrying that
        share of the *flagged* leverage, so 0.9 drops the tail that
        together accounts for a tenth of what the findings are worth;
        it adapts to the model where ``top`` does not. Measured against
        all kcats instead, the threshold would be unreachable, since
        flagged rows are a minority of the model's leverage.
    include
        Names from :data:`OPTIONAL_CHECKS` to report as well.
