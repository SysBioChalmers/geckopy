"""CMA-ES kcat tuning: fitting kcats to experimental data.

Three functions, normally called in this order:

- :func:`screen_kcat_leverage` -- report which kcats the data can
  actually speak to, with no optimisation involved. Perturbs each
  tie-group by +-``fold`` and measures the resulting change in RMSE,
  ranked by that leverage weighted by how much the source is trusted.
  Useful on its own for curation, independent of any tuning run.
- :func:`select_tunable_mask` -- turn a screen report into a boolean
  ``tunable_mask``, by keeping the fewest highest-ranked groups whose
  combined leverage reaches ``target_impact_share`` of the total. A
  *relative* cutoff, so the same ``target_impact_share`` selects a
  comparable quality of parameter set on a model with a different
  leverage scale, unlike an absolute threshold or a fixed count (see
  ``docs/internal/matlab_replication_results.md``, Open items #6).
- :func:`cmaes_kcat_tuning` -- the tuning run. Screens and selects
  automatically when no mask is given.

Parallel scoring (``n_proc``)
------------------------------
Each generation's new candidates are scored independently of each
other, so they parallelise across a process pool -- using
``cobra.util.process_pool.ProcessPool`` (the same primitive cobrapy's
own ``single_gene_deletion``/``single_reaction_deletion``/etc. use for
"repeated FBA on slightly-perturbed model copies", exactly this
module's shape of problem) rather than driving ``multiprocessing``
directly: one persistent ``EcModel`` copy per **worker process**
(deserialised once at pool startup, not once per particle and not one
shared mutable object across processes), which ``ProcessPool`` also
gets right on Windows for free (a temp-file-based initarg handoff that
works around a real performance issue in raw
``multiprocessing.Pool(initializer=...)`` there -- see its docstring).
Each worker then scores every particle it's handed against its own
copy via incremental ``apply_kcat_constraints(update_rxns=...)``
calls, exactly like the serial path -- see the "Spike results" section
of ``docs/internal/bayesian_tuning_plan.md`` for why a per-particle
``EcModel.copy()`` is not used either way (~225x an FBA solve on a
real-scale model).

CMA-ES's own ``ask``/``tell`` sequence stays single-threaded in the
main process -- it's cheap relative to FBA and, more importantly,
doing it there keeps the *sequence* of candidates proposed each
generation deterministic given ``seed``, independent of ``n_proc`` or
how work happens to be chunked across workers. Only the scoring of an
already-fixed batch of candidates is parallelised, and scoring is a
pure function of the kcat vector -- each candidate's solves start from
a cold basis (:func:`_reset_solver_basis`), so a worker's result does
not depend on which candidate it scored before. A run with ``n_proc=1``
and the same ``seed`` therefore reproduces bit-for-bit identical
results to one with ``n_proc>1``.

``make_anaerobic``/``change_protein_biomass``, if supplied, must be
importable top-level functions (not lambdas/closures) when running
with ``n_proc>1`` on Windows, where ``multiprocessing`` needs to
pickle them into each worker; POSIX's default start method (typically
``fork``, inherited via copy-on-write with no pickling involved) has
no such restriction.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rxns
        Tunable ``ec.rxns`` IDs, in the column order used throughout
        (``rxns[i]`` corresponds to ``old_kcat[i]``/``new_kcat[i]``/

        value in ``new_kcat``.
    old_kcat, new_kcat
        kcat values before/after tuning, parallel to ``rxns``.
    groups
        Source-group name per tunable row (from
        ``priors.classify_kcat_sources``).
    rmse_trace
        Best-so-far plain RMSE, per generation. Always the plain RMSE,
        so runs stay comparable across penalties and against MATLAB
        even when the search used a penalised objective.
    objective_trace
        Best-so-far value of the quantity the search actually
        minimised, per generation. Identical to ``rmse_trace`` when
        ``params.prior_penalty_weight`` is 0.
    n_generations
        Number of generations actually run.
    converged

    prior and a source move together when ``params.tie_isozymes``) is

    for. Groups are ranked by that leverage weighted by

    convention, where a trusted source needs proportionally more
    measured effect to rank alongside an untrusted one. This
    trust-weighting means the reported ``cum_leverage_share`` is a
    different quantity from :func:`~.parsimony.impact_share`, which is
    unweighted.

    Costs one simulation per condition per tie-group probed (two
    probes each, up and down) plus one baseline -- comparable in scale
    to a full tuning run's evaluation budget, not a cheap pre-check.
    FVA-unreachable kcats are not filtered out beforehand: a kcat that

        CMA-ES population size. Defaults to ``cma``'s own
        dimension-scaled default (``4 + floor(3 ln n)``), so it adapts
        to however many free parameters the mask/tying produced rather
        than a value calibrated on one particular model.
    n_proc
        Number of worker processes for scoring each generation's
        candidates. Defaults to ``cobra.Configuration().processes``.
        ``1`` runs the original serial path (no ``Pool`` at all). See
        the module docstring's "Parallel scoring" section.
    seed
        If given, seeds the search, for reproducible runs.
    verbose
        Whether per-generation progress is logged at INFO.
    make_anaerobic, change_protein_biomass
        Forwarded to ``simulate.simulate_bayesian_dataset`` -- see its
        docstring; geckopy has no generic organism-agnostic

    """Sweep ``prior_penalty_weight`` and report the fit/reproducibility
    trade-off, so the value doesn't have to be picked blind.

    ``prior_penalty_weight`` charges for moving a kcat away from its
    prior, and mainly exists to keep large corrections reproducible
    across seeds rather than landing on an arbitrary point along a flat
    direction. How strong a charge is enough is model- and
    data-specific: too little and the search's largest corrections
    disagree across seeds; too much and the search stops finding real
    corrections at all, giving up fit for nothing. This runs
    :func:`cmaes_kcat_tuning` at every value in ``candidates``, each at
    every seed in ``seeds``, all against the *same* tunable set (built
    once, the way :func:`cmaes_kcat_tuning` would on its own if
    ``tunable_mask``/``screen`` aren't given), and reports both fit and
    cross-seed reproducibility per value.

    This is exactly as expensive as it sounds: ``len(candidates) *
    len(seeds)`` full :func:`cmaes_kcat_tuning` runs, none of them
    reusable across candidates. Reuse a ``screen`` you already have to
    at least avoid recomputing that part.

    ``model`` is restored to its original kcats before every run and
    left that way when this returns -- unlike :func:`cmaes_kcat_tuning`,
    which mutates ``model`` with its result, this function only
    reports, since there is no single "best" candidate for it to leave
    the model in. Fewer than two ``seeds`` makes every reproducibility
    column ``NaN``, since there is nothing to compare.

    Parameters
    ----------
    candidates
        ``prior_penalty_weight`` values to try.
    seeds
        Seeds to run each candidate at. Reproducibility columns pool
        every pair of seeds, so more than two sharpens them but costs
        proportionally more.
    fold_threshold
        A kcat counts as "moved" past this fold change from its prior.
        Matches :func:`~.parsimony.fold_change`'s convention.
    tunable_mask, screen, target_impact_share, popsize, n_proc,
    make_anaerobic, change_protein_biomass, okp_method, bio_rxn
        As in :func:`cmaes_kcat_tuning`.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        One row per candidate: ``prior_penalty_weight``, ``n_seeds``,
        ``distance_mean`` and ``distance_spread`` (max minus min across
        seeds), ``fit_cost`` (``distance_mean`` relative to the best
        candidate's, as a fraction), ``n_changed_mean``, ``n_movers``
        (kcats past ``fold_threshold`` in *either* seed of a pair, summed
        over every pair), ``n_both_moved`` (past it in *both* -- the
        denominator for direction agreement, since a kcat only one seed
        moved has no direction to agree about), ``pct_direction_agree``,
        ``median_fold_spread`` and ``max_fold_spread`` (among movers,
        the largest fold-change between what the two seeds landed on).
