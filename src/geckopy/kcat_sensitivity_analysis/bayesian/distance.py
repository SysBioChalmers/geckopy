"""Carbon- and condition-weighted RMSE distance for Bayesian kcat tuning.

Ported from GECKO MATLAB:
src/geckomat/kcat_sensitivity_analysis/Bayesian/abc_max.m (the
``rmsecal`` helper's RMSE half; verified against ``develop4``'s
current source). :mod:`.simulate` does the FBA half -- this module is
pure numpy (plus one small model-reading helper for the carbon
weights) so the RMSE math is directly testable against hand-computed
expected values, no ``EcModel``/FBA involved.

Two MATLAB behaviours are intentionally *not* ported, per
``REVIEW.md``'s findings against ``develop4``:

- ``addCarbonNum.m`` matches the biomass reaction by the literal name
  ``'growth'`` (REVIEW.md #4) -- silently a no-op for any adapter that
  doesn't use that exact name. Here the caller passes the real
  ``bio_rxn_id`` explicitly (``adapter.params.bio_rxn``) instead.
- ``rmsecal`` recomputes ``ismember(data.conds, data.exchMets)`` (and
  its validation) on every inner-loop iteration despite it not
  depending on the loop variable (REVIEW.md, low severity) --
  :func:`dataset_rmse` builds its reaction-id-to-column lookup once.

One quirk *is* ported deliberately, because it changes what the RMSE
actually measures: MATLAB's ``ecModel.excarbon(ecModel.excarbon == 0)
= 1`` clamps *every* zero-carbon exchange metabolite (O2, water, ...)
up to a carbon weight of 1, not 0 -- so those reactions' flux
mismatches still count toward the RMSE at unit weight rather than
being silently zeroed out of it. See :func:`compute_excarbon`.

    hand-rolled formula parser). A missing/unparseable formula, or a
    computed carbon count of exactly 0 (e.g. O2, water), both fall
    back to 1 -- matching MATLAB's ``Ematrix(isnan(Ematrix)) = 1`` and

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_growth_weight
        Relative weight of the max-growth dataset against the flux

        At 2 the eight max-growth conditions carry twice the weight of
        the 33 flux conditions, which is the intended emphasis here:
        the max-growth set is where the carbon-source diversity lives,
        while 30 of the 33 flux conditions are glucose.

        This is deliberately not MATLAB's convention. ``abc_max.m``
        applies ``weights = [maxGrowthWeight, 1]`` to
        ``[rmse_flux, rmse_maxGrate]``, so there the same field scales
        the *flux* term. **A run reproducing MATLAB must pass 0.5
        here** to match its ``maxGrowthWeight = 2``.
