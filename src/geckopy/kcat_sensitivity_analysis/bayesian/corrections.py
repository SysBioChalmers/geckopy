"""Report a tuning result as the corrections it makes.

A tuned kcat vector is one number per enzyme-reaction pair, and on a
genome-scale model that is thousands of numbers of which a few dozen
are supported by the data. Read as a vector it cannot be checked. Read
as a ranked list of changes, each carrying where its old value came
from and how much of the model's measured sensitivity it accounts for,
it can: a reviewer can look up whether one enzyme is really that slow.

The ranking is by *leverage* -- how far the distance moves when that
kcat alone is perturbed -- rather than by how far the tuning moved it.
Sorting by movement puts the parameters the data cannot see at the top,
since those are free to drift furthest. ``cumulative_share`` says how
much of the total leverage the list has accounted for by each row, so a
reader can stop where it stops climbing.

    ----------
    kcat, kcat0
        Tuned and prior kcat vectors, same length as ``rxn_ids``.
    sources, names, ec_codes
        Per-kcat provenance. Missing entries are reported as ``""``

    leverage
        Per-kcat effect on the distance from a one-at-a-time screen. If
        given, rows are ordered by it and the share columns are filled;
        otherwise rows are ordered by fold change and the shares are 0.
    rel_tol
        A kcat within ``1 + rel_tol`` fold of its prior is unchanged.
