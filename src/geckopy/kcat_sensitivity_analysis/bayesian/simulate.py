"""FBA simulation half of the Bayesian kcat-tuning distance function.

Ported from GECKO MATLAB:
src/geckomat/kcat_sensitivity_analysis/Bayesian/abc_max.m (the
``rmsecal`` helper's simulate-and-measure loop). Verified against
``develop4``'s current source, not the (superseded, per its own
``REVIEW.md``) ``fix/bayesianTuning`` branch.

This module only does the FBA half: given an already kcat-constrained
``EcModel`` and one :class:`~geckopy.databases.flux_data.FluxData`
dataset (either ``bay_data.flux_data`` or ``bay_data.max_grate``),
simulate every condition and report growth + exchange fluxes.
:mod:`.distance` turns those raw numbers into an RMSE against the
matching experimental values -- kept separate so the RMSE math is
testable with hand-built inputs and no ``EcModel``/FBA at all.

    """Simulate every condition in one Bayesian dataset.

    Mirrors ``abc_max.m``'s ``rmsecal`` FBA half:

    1. Every exchange reaction that appears as a *condition name*
       anywhere in ``flux_data.conds`` (matched by name against
       ``flux_data.exch_mets``) is blocked (``lower_bound = 0``) up
       front, across the board -- not just the reaction for the row
       being solved -- so one row's carbon source can't leak flux into
       another row's simulation.
    2. For row ``i``, that row's own carbon-source reaction is
       unblocked: fixed at the measured uptake rate if ``constrain``
       is True (``bay_data.flux_data``), or fully opened to ``-1000``
       if ``constrain`` is False (``bay_data.max_grate`` -- "what's
       the *best possible* growth on this carbon source", not "growth
       at this measured rate").
    3. Optional per-condition adjustments run if the corresponding
       callable is supplied: anaerobic switch when the oxygen exchange
       column reads exactly 0, protein-content rescaling when
       ``Ptot`` is given and nonzero.
    4. Solve; record growth, plus (``constrain`` datasets only, since
       ``max_grate`` has no exchange measurements to compare against)
       every non-NaN measured exchange's simulated flux and every
       ``zero_flux_rxns`` entry's simulated flux.

    All mutation happens inside ``with model:``, which cobra reverts
    on exit -- only bounds are touched here, so this is safe to call
    repeatedly against one persistent (per-worker) model instance; see
    the "Spike results" section of
    ``docs/internal/bayesian_tuning_plan.md`` for why per-particle
    ``EcModel.copy()`` is not used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        EcModel with the current particle's kcats already applied
        (via ``apply_kcat_constraints``).
    flux_data
        The dataset to simulate.
    constrain
        True for flux data (fix uptake at the measured rate), False
        for max-growth data (open uptake fully).
    zero_flux_rxns
        Reaction IDs assumed zero-flux in every condition
        (``bay_data.zero_flux``); the row's own carbon source is
        skipped even if it's also listed here.
    bio_rxn_id
        The biomass reaction ID (``adapter.params.bio_rxn``).
    make_anaerobic, change_protein_biomass
        Optional adapter-specific hooks (MATLAB:
        ``modelAdapter.makeModelAnaerobic`` /
        ``.changeProteinBiomass``). geckopy has no generic,
        organism-agnostic port of these yet -- in MATLAB they're
        written per model-adapter subclass (e.g.
        ``YeastGEMAdapter.m``). Left as an injection point rather
        than a hard requirement: data with no anaerobic/``Ptot`` rows
        never needs them, and passing ``None`` for either just skips
        that adjustment instead of raising.

    Returns
    -------
    list[ConditionSimResult]
        One entry per row of ``flux_data.conds``, in order.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any ``flux_data.conds`` entry can't be matched by name to
        an exchange metabolite in ``flux_data.exch_mets``.
