"""Stop sampling distinctions the kcat assignment never made.

A reaction catalysed by several isozymes gets one ``ec.rxns`` row per
isozyme, each with its own kcat. Where the assignment could tell them
apart -- different databases, different sequences, different measured
values -- those are genuinely different parameters. Where it could not,
every copy receives the same number from the same source, and the
tuner is then free to give them different values because no condition
can distinguish which isozyme carries the flux.

It does exactly that. Five copies of ``r_0438`` share a prior of
54.33 1/s and come out of one run at 4.1, 8.1, 16.4 and 427 -- a
hundredfold spread that reports nothing about biology and everything
about an unidentified direction in the objective.

Tying makes the copies one parameter. Copies must share both the prior
value and the source group to be tied: a shared value arrived at by
different routes is a coincidence, not an indistinguishability.
