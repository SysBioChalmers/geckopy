    Ported from GECKO MATLAB:
    src/geckomat/change_model/applyComplexData.m.

    For each catalyzed reaction in ``ec.rxns``, look up its enzyme set
    in the ComplexPortal data. Three outcomes:

    Exact match
        The model's enzyme set equals a complex's protein list, with no
        extras on either side. Apply the complex's stoichiometry.

    Proposed (subset)
        Either: every model enzyme is in some complex, but the complex
        lists additional subunits not in the model (closest superset
        is reported). Or: ``min_match_to_propose`` (default 0.75) of
        model enzymes are in some complex, with extras or substitutions
        on the model side. Logged as WARNING; not applied.

    No match
        Skipped silently.

    MATLAB-COMPAT: MATLAB returns three outputs (model, foundComplex,
    proposedComplex). geckopy returns None and logs proposals.

    MATLAB-COMPAT: MATLAB does NOT call applyKcatConstraints; users
    must remember to do it. geckopy auto-applies (apply=True) since
    changing rxn_enz_mat invalidates kcat coefficients.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        An EcModel produced by ``make_ec_model``. Mutated in place.
    path
        Path to a ComplexPortal JSON file. If None and complex_data is
        also None, defaults to
        ``adapter.params.path / "data" / "ComplexPortal.json"``.
    complex_data
        Pre-loaded list of ComplexPortalEntry. Overrides ``path``.
    apply
        If True (default), call ``apply_kcat_constraints`` after.
    min_match_to_propose
        Minimum fraction of model enzymes in a complex for it to be
        reported as a proposal. MATLAB hardcodes 0.75.

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError
        If neither ``complex_data`` nor a valid ``path`` is provided.
