    """Set kcat values for one or more reactions in ec.kcat.

    Each ID in ``rxn_ids`` is interpreted as follows:

    - If the ID ends in ``_EXP_<n>`` (full layout) or starts with
      ``###_`` (gecko-light), only that exact reaction is matched.
    - Otherwise, the ID is treated as a base name and matches every
      ec.rxns entry whose ID, after stripping the layout-specific
      isozyme marker, equals the base name. So in a full model,
      ``"R2"`` matches ``R2``, ``R2_EXP_1``, ``R2_EXP_2``; in a light
      model, ``"R2"`` matches ``001_R2``, ``002_R2``.

    The ``kcat`` argument follows numpy-style broadcasting: a single
    float applies to every matched reaction; a sequence of length
    ``len(rxn_ids)`` gives one value per input ID (broadcast across
    that ID's own matches); a sequence of length equal to the total
    number of matched reactions gives one value per resolved match, in
    ``ec.rxns`` order.

    That last form lets one un-suffixed ``rxn_id`` that expands to
    multiple isozymes take a list of per-isozyme values, matching
    MATLAB ``setKcatForReactions``'s positional semantics exactly:
    values are assigned to matches in whatever order they occur in
    ``ec.rxns``, with no check that this is the order the caller
    intended. This is real but fragile as an API surface -- prefer
    passing the suffixed reaction IDs explicitly when the mapping
    matters, so intent doesn't depend on ``ec.rxns``'s row order.

    ``ec.source`` is set to ``"setKcatForReactions"`` for every
    reaction changed by this call, matching MATLAB's ``ec.source``
    label (its own docstring says ``'from setKcatForReactions'``, but
    the actual assignment writes the bare function name).

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        An EcModel with ec.rxns populated. Mutated in place.
    rxn_ids
        Reaction identifiers to update.
    kcat
        New kcat value(s) in 1/s. Scalar or sequence (see above).
    apply
        If True (default), call ``apply_kcat_constraints`` after
        updating ec.kcat / ec.source so the change is reflected in the
        S matrix immediately. If False, the caller must invoke
        ``apply_kcat_constraints`` themselves.

    Returns
    -------
    list of str
        IDs of the reactions whose kcat was changed (the post-expansion
        set), in the order in which they were updated.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any rxn_id matches zero reactions, or if kcat has a length
        other than 1, ``len(rxn_ids)``, or the total number of resolved
        matches.
