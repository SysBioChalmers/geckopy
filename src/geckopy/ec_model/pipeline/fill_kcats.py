    Two reactions are siblings if their ``ec.rxns`` IDs are identical
    after stripping any ``_EXP_<n>`` suffix. The ``_REV`` suffix is
    NOT stripped: forward and reverse reactions share chemistry but
    can have different kcats, so they are kept distinct.

    For each reaction with no kcat assigned (``ec.kcat == 0``), find
    its siblings whose kcat is set (``> 0``). If any exist, take their
    mean and assign it. Set ``ec.source`` to ``"isozymes"`` for the
    filled entries.

    Reactions whose siblings all also lack a kcat stay at 0. Reactions
    with a single isozyme (no siblings beyond themselves) also stay at 0.

    ``get_kcat_across_isozymes`` is a deprecated alias for this function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        An EcModel produced by ``make_ec_model``. Mutated in place.
        Must not be a gecko-light model.
    apply
        If True (default), call ``apply_kcat_constraints`` after
        updating ec.kcat so the new values reflect in the S matrix.
    aggregate
        How to combine sibling kcats: ``"mean"`` (matches MATLAB GECKO),
        ``"median"`` (more robust for log-distributed rate constants), or
        ``"max"``. ``None`` (default) reads
        ``model.adapter.params.kcat_aggregate_isozymes`` if an adapter is
        attached, falling back to ``"mean"`` otherwise.

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If ``model.ec.gecko_light`` is True. Isozyme-averaging does not
        apply to the light formulation since it does not split
        reactions per isozyme.
