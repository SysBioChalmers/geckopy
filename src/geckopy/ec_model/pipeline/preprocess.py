    Ported from GECKO MATLAB: src/geckomat/change_model/makeEcModel.m
    (stage 1, inline block). No RAVEN equivalent. A reaction is
    treated as a pseudoreaction if either:

    - its name contains the substring ``pseudoreaction`` (case-sensitive,
      matching MATLAB's default `contains` behavior); or
    - its ID is listed in the first column of ``data/pseudoRxns.tsv``

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        A cobra.Model that will be mutated in place: the gene reaction
        rule of each matched reaction is cleared (empty string). This
        automatically updates the reaction's `.genes` set via cobrapy's
        GPR handling.
    adapter
