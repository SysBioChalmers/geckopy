"""Apply kcat-derived stoichiometric constraints to an ecModel.

Ported from GECKO MATLAB: src/geckomat/change_model/applyKcatConstraints.m.
Supports both the full and gecko-light formulations. The two share the
clear-then-write idempotency contract but write to different metabolites:
full models write per-enzyme ``prot_<id>`` coefficients on each ec.rxn;
light models pick the lowest-cost isozyme per cobra reaction and write a
single ``prot_pool`` coefficient there.

    """Translate ec.kcat values into stoichiometric coefficients.

    For each reaction in ``ec.rxns`` with a valid kcat and at least one
    associated enzyme, writes a negative coefficient at
    ``S[prot_<enzyme>, rxn]`` of magnitude::

        subunits * MW / (kcat * 3600)

    where ``subunits`` is the corresponding entry of ``ec.rxn_enz_mat``
    (1 for a single subunit, higher for multi-copy complexes), ``MW``
    is the enzyme molecular weight from ``ec.mw`` (in Da), and the
    factor 3600 converts kcat from 1/s (its conventional unit and the
    unit used in ``ec.kcat``) to 1/h so it aligns with cobrapy's
    mmol/gDW/h flux convention.

    Entries with kcat == 0 or kcat == NaN are treated as "no kcat
    assigned"; their stoichiometric coefficients are set to 0 (i.e.,
    the enzyme places no constraint on that reaction).

    The function is idempotent: existing non-zero coefficients at
    ``S[prot_<enzyme>, rxn]`` are first cleared for the reactions being
    updated, then freshly written from current ec.kcat. Running it
    twice yields the same result as running it once. Setting a kcat
    back to NaN/0 and re-applying clears the previously written
    coefficient.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        An EcModel produced by ``make_ec_model``, with at least some
        kcat values assigned to ``model.ec.kcat``. Mutated in place.
    update_rxns
        Reaction IDs (from ``model.ec.rxns``) to update. If None,
        updates all entries.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``update_rxns`` contains IDs not present in ``ec.rxns``.

    Warns
    -----
    UserWarning
        If every kcat to be applied is 0 or NaN. Old coefficients are
        still cleared in this case; nothing is written afterward.

    Light ec.rxns has one row per isozyme of each
