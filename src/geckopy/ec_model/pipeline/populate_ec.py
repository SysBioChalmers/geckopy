"""Build and populate the ec substructure on an EcModel.

Covers stages 6, 7, and 8 of GECKO MATLAB `makeEcModel.m`:

- Stage 6 allocates empty per-reaction slots in ec (one per catalyzed
  reaction after stage-5 expansion).
- Stage 7 fills in per-enzyme data (genes, uniprot IDs, MW, sequence,
  concentrations) by looking up each model gene in the UniProt
  database. Genes that do not match UniProt are left out of ec and
  returned as a warning list; their parent reactions are also flagged
  with a note in rxn.notes.
- Stage 8 populates the reaction-to-enzyme coupling matrix
  (ec.rxn_enz_mat) with 1.0 for each (reaction, enzyme) pair implied
  by the reaction's GPR.

These three stages are only meaningful for the full (non-light) ecModel
format. Gecko-light is handled by a separate future module.

All three functions mutate the ec substructure in place. None of them
talk to the network.

    Ported from GECKO MATLAB: src/geckomat/change_model/makeEcModel.m
    (stage 7), extended with a KEGG fallback that MATLAB does not have.

    MATLAB-COMPAT: GECKO MATLAB iterates model.genes in their original
    model order. geckopy iterates them in alphabetical order so that
    ec.genes / ec.enzymes / ec.mw / ec.sequence are deterministic
    regardless of how the SBML was loaded.

    For every gene in the model (sorted alphabetically for reproducibility),
    a lookup is performed:

    1. ``adapter.get_uniprot_compatible_genes`` transforms model gene IDs
       into a form that should match the UniProt "Gene Names" column.
    2. If an ``uniprotConversion.tsv`` is present, it instead transforms
       model gene IDs directly to UniProt IDs and matches on the "Entry"
       column.

    Matched genes are added to ec.genes / ec.enzymes / ec.mw /
    ec.sequence (same length as ec.genes), and ec.concs is allocated as
    NaN of matching length. Unmatched genes are returned as a list
    (the equivalent of MATLAB's ``noUniprot``).

    When ``kegg_db`` is supplied, each gene UniProt could not match is
    looked up in the KEGG database via
    ``adapter.get_kegg_compatible_genes``. KEGG hits feed ec.enzymes
    with the UniProt accession stored on the KEGG entry; if that is
    empty, the bare KEGG gene ID (``KeggDB.kegg_genes``) is used as a
    fallback identifier. The returned ``no_uniprot`` list then names
    only the genes that neither source could fill.

    MATLAB-COMPAT: GECKO MATLAB only returns the noUniprot list and
    does not annotate the affected reactions. geckopy additionally
    writes a note to rxn.notes['geckopy_warning'] for each affected
    reaction so users can see the issue when inspecting individual
    reactions. MATLAB GECKO could be updated to do the same.

    Reactions whose GPR references an unmatched gene get a warning note
    added to ``rxn.notes[geckopy_warning]``. If such a reaction has at
    least one other matched gene, it will still be enzyme-constrained
    through that gene. If all its genes are unmatched it will be
    unconstrained.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        An EcModel. Must have ``adapter`` set. Mutated in place.
    uniprot_db
