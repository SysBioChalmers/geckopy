"""``EcModel``: a regular ``cobra.Model`` extended with enzyme data.

An ``EcModel`` *is* a cobra model (it subclasses ``cobra.Model``),
so everything you know how to do with cobra still works: solve
FBAs, edit reactions, inspect metabolites, etc.

It carries two extra attributes on top of cobra:

- ``ec``: an ``EcData`` holding the enzyme-related arrays (kcats,
  enzyme MW, the reaction-enzyme coupling matrix, ...).
- ``adapter``: the ``ModelAdapter`` used to build it, so downstream
  helper functions can reach organism-specific parameters
  (taxonomy id, biomass reaction, ...) without being passed
  the adapter explicitly every time.

There is also an ``enzymes`` view on every EcModel that lets you
write ``model.enzymes.get_by_id("P00350").kcats["R_FOO"] = 30.0``
to update an enzyme-level constraint through a friendly proxy.
See ``geckopy.ec_model.enzyme.Enzyme`` for the full surface.

    ----------
    ec : EcData
        The enzyme-constraint data: kcats, enzyme MW, sequence,
        proteomics concentrations, and the sparse matrix saying
        which enzymes catalyse which reactions. See
        ``geckopy.ec_model.ec_data.EcData``.
    adapter : ModelAdapter or None
        The adapter the ecModel was built with (organism
        parameters, paths, etc.). ``None`` if the model was loaded
        from disk and no adapter was attached at load time.
    enzymes : EnzymeView
        Lazy view that lets you reach individual enzymes via
        ``model.enzymes.get_by_id("P00350")``. Each call returns a
        live ``Enzyme`` proxy; reads and writes always go through
        the underlying ``ec`` data.
